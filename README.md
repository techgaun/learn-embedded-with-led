# learn-embedded-with-led
A walkthrough tutorial for learning embedded programming with LEDs

This tutorial walks through embedded programming by using LED as an example. I will be using [ATtiny85](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATtiny85) and [Raspberyy PI Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/) for my examples. I will be using [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) for all of my examples.

### 01 - Turn on/off a LED
